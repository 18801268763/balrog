<p>I began <a href="http://jlord.github.io/sheetsee.js">Sheetsee</a> last year as an effort to make wider use of existing, free and easy to use web technologies. I&#39;m always hacking on it and always trying to make it easier to use.</p>

<p>I think that using a Google Spreadsheet as a database can quickly and easily solve a lot of the initial barriers to getting-going that prevent even savy developers from starting even a simple website if it requires a database. More so I think that using Google Spreadsheet as a database can bring simple and easy control to many people.</p>
<p>Because you can easily pick contributors, viewers; share raw or connect to a Google Form - collaborating on information can become really, really easy. When connected to a templated website, the information becomes more meaningful.</p>
<p>Currently there is <a href="http://www.github.com/jlord/sheetsee-cache">sheetsee-cache</a>, a node.js caching version, <a href="http://jlord.github.io/sheetsee.js">Sheetsee</a>, the basic client-side version which is much more accessible. Recently I&#39;ve started getting excited about an iteration even more approachable, making use of the free and easy hosting through <a href="http://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a>.</p>
